# Quiz-Flutter
A Flutter quiz app that uses Riverpod for state management and Supabase for backend services. The app will allow users to sign in, take quizzes, and view their scores. The quiz data will be fetched from Supabase, and user-specific data such as scores will be stored in Supabase as well.
